# Stock Prediction using LSTM
 The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict future stock prices based on historical data. It utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly well-suited for time series forecasting.
